## This code accomplishes the following 
* Style page in accordance with University Visual Identity guidelines
* Clarify ArtStor usage
* Simplify link bar to re-use existing library website links
* Group Summon Results (Online holdings, University Holdings, Consortial Holdings)
* Style grouping elements to be inserted

### Notes about Result Groupings
* Summon results display on a single page
* Content is appended as user scrolls
* Page content could get very large
* Need to mark results that have already been processed
* Need to process markup that is added later
